        Apple stores.
        In my role as a certified Senior Apple Technician, I help provide customers with an authentic Apple experience,
        by providing in-store product training (including for all models of Macs), technical support, and technical setup.

        Technical Consultant. I have accumulated lots of face-to-face time with customers, and I have built up a loyal
        customer base.</p>
